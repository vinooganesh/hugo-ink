The web is changing. AI crawlers now read your site alongside traditional search engines. Is your site ready?

## What is llms.txt?

The `llms.txt` standard gives AI models a structured entry point to your site's most important content. Think of it as `robots.txt` for AI.

## JSON-LD structured data

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Making Your Site AI-Ready",
  "datePublished": "2026-02-13"
}
```

## Why it matters

When AI tools answer questions, they pull from indexed web content. Clean structured data means your content gets accurately cited.
