This is the first post on a new site. If you're reading this, the theme is working.

## Why this exists

Every few years I rebuild my personal site. This time I wanted something that loads fast, looks clean, and gets out of the way.

## The stack

- **Hugo** for static site generation
- **Ink** as the theme
- Self-hosted Inter font, no external requests

## Code example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

> The best websites are the ones that get out of your way.

## What's next

More writing. More building. Fewer dependencies.
